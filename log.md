# Notes #
* The methods don't really match up with the left dependency graph. What's going on with that? There is no Declaration in the LDG.

The things in the LDG are *concrete* tokens, and the methods in the parser correspond to *abstract* tokens. See page 77. Concrete Identifier corresponds to abstract Variable.
